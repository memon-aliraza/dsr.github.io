Project objectives
In this project we first perform a statistical exploratory analysis of the dataset. Secondly, we plan to experiment the performance of various state-of-the-art classifiers on this dataset. For a better understanding of this classification task, we study the evaluation measures for the multilabel scenario. In the process, we try to answer the following research questions:

* How well the classifiers perform over Eur-Lex dataset for two languages (English and Deutsch).
* How the classifiers’ performance changes with different features- one with term frequency–inverse document frequency(tf-idf), another with term incidence.
* How the classifiers’ performance changes when the number of labels is reduced
