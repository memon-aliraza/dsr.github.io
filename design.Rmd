Statistical exploration :

* Basic exploration - distribution of attributes/labels
* Multi-label specific exploration- labelset distribution, relationship among labels, and relationship between attributes and labels/labelsets

Pre-processing :

* Exclude stop words, perform stemming or lemmatization.
* Extract features - term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency(tf-idf) and term incidence.
* Generate the MLD [1] data format, which is needed for multi label data exploration and classification using mldr[2] and utiml[3] packages .
* Apply (atleast) the following classifiers over the preprocessed dataset.

* IBk (Nearest Neighbour)
* RandomForest
* SVM

The following evaluation measures cab be used to assess the multilabel predictive performance:

* Accuracy
* Hamming Loss
* Average Precision and Recall
* Coverage
* Ranking Loss

Compare the accuracies of the state-of-the-art classifiers on this dataset, for two languages.
